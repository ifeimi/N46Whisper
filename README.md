# Whisper48

\
This README file serves as a summary of the structure and content of the project. Detailed explanation for the script and helping information can be found on [my website](https://ifeimi.github.io/whisper48/).  

## 云端运行 Working on Google Colab

WhisperX: This project is deployed as a notebook on Google Colab, [click to open](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ifeimi/Whisper48/blob/main/WhisperX48.ipynb). Follow the instructions and excecute each cell in order.  

## 本地运行 Working locally

Try running [this script](https://github.com/ifeimi/Whisper48/blob/main/WhisperX48_local.ipynb) on your own computer. You are going to need adequate knowledge to install PyTorch, WhisperX, ffmpeg, ... on your computer first. The script is not tested yet. 

## 示例 Examples

I will update some subtitile examples generated by WhisperX and comparison with other models in the near future. This will include subtitles for short videos, long videos, and music-containing videos. However corresponding video or audio files will not be provided due to copyright reasons.  

## 参与和帮助 Contribute and Support

Recent update of WhisperX integrated faster-whisper, however Japanese timestamping have become problematic. See [Issue #200 *V3 sentence segement issue*](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/issues/200). However faster-whisper integrated in [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper) does give shorter and accurate segments. I'm still working on this problem and try to add forced alignment to N46Whisper's output. 
\
I modify this project strongly according to my demands. But feel free to submit issues or directly contact me if you have any suggestions. I also encourage you to contribute to the "original" [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper) project as well.  
\
Contact me anytime by email: yfwu0202 AT gmail dot com. I would love to help with any questions and hear any kind suggestions from you.  
\
Please also consult documentations for [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/README.md), [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/blob/main/README.md), and [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper).  

## 致谢和版权 Acknowledgements and Copyright notice  

This project started as a fork from [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper). Part of the code was left unchanged and used under [MIT license](https://github.com/ifeimi/WhisperX48/blob/main/LICENSE). Modifications were made to incorporate the usage of more accurate Whisper-based models ([WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) for example) and to adapt for other personal demands.  
\
This script relies on [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX), which provides an improvement to [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) with more accurate and even word-level timestamps. This is achieved by forcing align the inaccurate timestamps generated by whisper with some speech model ([wav2vec2.0](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self) for example).
